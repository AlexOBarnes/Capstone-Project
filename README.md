# Capstone-Project
This repository contains the files for a simple hangman game<br />
Once all the files have been downloaded, store all the files together in a folder of your chosing. Alternatively, enter a working directory path so that the main python 
code can read the english_dictionary.txt file.<br />
Before running the main program, install the replit package if not installed already.<br />
Once run, the program will greet you with a welcome message and will immediately generate a word.<br />
The user can then submit any letter as a guess until they either lose the game after 8 wrong guesses or win the game once the word has been revealed.<br />
Finally, the user can choose to exit the program or play again with a new word.
